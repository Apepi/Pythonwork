# Python Portfolio
Welcome to my Python portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills and experience as a Python developer.

## Contents
This portfolio currently includes five main projects:

### 1. Bookstore Management System
- A SQLite-based application for managing a bookstore's inventory
- Demonstrates database operations, user input handling, and error management

### 2. Task Management System
- A text file-based task and user management application
- Showcases file I/O operations, date handling, and user authentication

### 3. Solar Controller Data Logger
- A script for retrieving data from a SRNE solar controller and logging it to InfluxDB
- Demonstrates IoT device communication, time-series data handling, and integration with cloud databases

### 4. MoneyWiz
- A command-line personal finance tracker built with Python
- Features expense tracking, income management, budget setting, and financial goal tracking
- Utilizes SQLite for local data storage and demonstrates database operations, user input handling, and financial calculations

### 5. Image Steganography Tool
- A Python implementation for hiding and extracting secret messages within images
- Uses LSB (Least Significant Bit) technique with minimal visual impact
- Demonstrates image processing, binary operations, and NumPy array manipulation
- Features efficient pixel manipulation and built-in message validation

Each project has its own directory with a dedicated README providing more details on its purpose, features, and how to run the code.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Clean, well-documented code following PEP 8 standards
- IoT device communication (Modbus RTU)
- Integration with time-series databases (InfluxDB)
- Real-time data logging and monitoring
- Configuration management for deployable scripts
- Personal finance management algorithms
- Data summarization and reporting
- Image processing and binary operations
- NumPy array manipulation
- Steganography techniques

# Python Portfolio

Welcome to my Python portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills and experience as a Python developer.

## Contents

This portfolio currently includes two main projects:

### 1. Bookstore Management System
- A SQLite-based application for managing a bookstore's inventory
- Demonstrates database operations, user input handling, and error management

### 2. Task Management System
- A text file-based task and user management application
- Showcases file I/O operations, date handling, and user authentication

Each project has its own directory with a dedicated README providing more details on its purpose, features, and how to run the code.

## Skills Demonstrated

Through these projects, you'll see examples of my proficiency in:

- Python 3.x
- Database management with SQLite
- File I/O operations
- User input validation and error handling
- Date and time manipulation
- Basic authentication systems
- Command-line interface design
- Clean, well-documented code following PEP 8 standards
